        Part 0: Graphing Parent Functions and Transformations

        Before we get started on piecewise functions, it’s important you know
        these major parent functions (leaving out trig functions):

        Now that you should be familiar with these two concepts in the world of
        functions, it’s time to explore functions like these:

      <p class="center-content hidden">
        You may be questioning whether or not this is even a function and what
        its parent is. Well we can first confirm that it is a function because
        each input only has one output, in other words, it passes the vertical
        line test:

      <p class="center-content hidden">
        Now that we know it is a function, we can dive into this type of
        function (the piecewise function) and figure out what its parent is.

      <h3 class="section-title hidden">Part 1: The Piecewise Function</h3>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Now, when I said that we would find the parent to this function, I was
        partially lying (oops!). The fact is, this function has many parents.
        Although some piecewise functions do only have one parent, some have
        many. Sometimes, a piecewise function is made of 2 or more functions of
        the
        <span class="emphasis">same parent</span>. Other times, a piecewise
        function is made of 2 or more functions of
        <span class="emphasis">different parents</span>. The thing that defines
        a piecewise function is that it is composed of
        <span class="emphasis">pieces</span>
        of <span class="emphasis">2 or more</span> functions!
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        With this knowledge, let’s split this piecewise function into its
        different parts. A good trick is to find any place the piecewise
        function changes direction angularly and splice it.
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">

        /></a>
      </div>

      <p class="center-content hidden">
        As you can tell, once we have the piecewise function split up based on
        its "parts", we can start to see the different functions it is made up
        of! Some of the function is linear while another part is a section of a
        quadratic!
      </p>
      <div class="container-blue hidden">
        <h1>Special Case!</h1>
        <p>
          You may be wondering how you would split a piecewise function like
          this:
        </p>
        <div class="image-1 hidden">
          <a
            ><img

          /></a>
        </div>
        <p>
          Now the fact is, this isn’t a piecewise function, it’s just a
          relationship. Because don’t forget, if we drew the vertical line on
          this function... It would fail the test!

      </div>

        So now that you are familiar with the graphs of piecewise functions,
        let’s move onto their equations.

        Part 2: Evaluating Equations of Piecewise Functions
      </h3>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Here’s what a piecewise function equation looks like:
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img

            style="width: 25rem; margin: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        The basic components of a piecewise function are the:
      </p>
      <ul class="list left-content hidden">
        <li>f(x) or output</li>
        <li>the curly braces</li>
        <li>the equations</li>
        <li>restrictions/conditions</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="inline">
        <p class="flexed-left hidden" >
          The output of f(x) is just like any other function, it names the
          function and represents the output. The curly braces are there to show
          that these modular equations are all part of this one function. These
          components are the regular parent functions that you are familiar with
          but all squished into one function. The components are the parts that
          we spent splicing previously in part 1, just in equation forms. Now
          with these individual modular functions, we need to be able to tell
          them to stop existing at certain points, and we use restrictions in
          the domain (x) to accomplish this!
        </p>
        <div class="image-1 hidden">
          <a
            ><img
              src="public/Equation parts.png"

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="center-content hidden">
        Here we can see this linear equation component of the piecewise function
        stops at x = 4, so in the section that defines the respective linear
        function, we state that the function only works if x ≤ 4. If there is a
        closed dot at that section, then it means the linear function hits x =
        4, however, if it were an open dot, then the function does not hit x =
        4, and thus the restriction would be x < 4
      </p>
      <p class="center-content hidden">
        Now, we can move on to drawing piecewise functions based on their
        equation.

        Part 3: Drawing Piecewise Functions From Equations
      </h3>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Drawing piecewise functions may seem daunting but it's much easier than
        it seems. We are already familiar with graphing many different functions
        based on their equations and transformations, now we just need to put
        those graphs all on the same cartesian plane and enable their
        restrictions!
      </p>
      <p class="centered-large hidden">
        So here we have the equation of a piecewise function:
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/Piecewise equation2.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
    </div>
      <p class="centered-large hidden">
        Let’s focus only on the first component, and slowly move down the
        equation...
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        It is a simple linear equation in its y intercept form. We can simply
        graph it like normal, with the y intercept being b and the m being the
        slope.
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/line.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        So once we have it graphed, we have to make sure we keep it only in its
        domain. So the restriction says it only exists if x is less than 2, so
        we keep all the values beneath and not equal to 2. Because it is not
        equal, we leave an open dot.
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/Line cut.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content">
        Next, we look at the second component of the piecewise function. This
        portion is a quadratic. Based on the transformations, we know that the
        graph is shifted 5 to the right. So we graph the parabola on
        the same plane as our previous linear equation.
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/PiecewisePrior.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content">
        Now that the parabola is plotted, we need to remind ourselves of its
        restrictions, it only exists if x is more than or equal to 2, so we
        remove all the outputs after x = 2. Since the function includes x = 2,
        it must be a filled dot.
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/Piecewise first.png"

        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Now that both functions meet up together, we can see that the open dot
        from the linear function is filled by the solid dot in the quadratic
        function, thus making the functions connect perfectly with only one
        output for each input (to make it a function). We will have an
        opportunity to sketch a difficult example piecewise function in the end.
      </p>
      <p class="center-content hidden">
        Now that you know how to graph a piecewise function from its equation,
        we will need to work backwards and learn to get the equation of a
        piecewise function from its graph.

        Part 4: Determining the Equation of a Piecewise Function From Its Graph
      </h3>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Finding the equation of a piecewise function from its graph is like
        finding the equation of any parent function from its graph. Determine
        the parent function and use transformations and substitution to
        determine the equation. The only new part is determining the components
        of the piecewise graph that are different functions (which we did in
        part 1!) and writing out the restrictions.
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">So here is a piecewise function:</p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/PiecewiseClose.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        The first step is to split it up into its components just like we did in
        part 1.
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/PiecewiseClose split.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Now that you know its components, you will want to choose a part and
        start by determining its parent. In this case, the left-most function
        component is linear. So we can take the component and extend it out in
        our minds to determine the equation before the restriction was placed.
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/Line of Piecewise.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Now that we have the first components full graph, we can see that its y
        intercept is 2 and its slope is -1. So we write out its equation and go
        back to our piecewise function. We can see that the first function stops
        at x = 2 and meets up with another function. If it meets up with another
        function, one of the functions has to have an open dot and the other has
        to have a closed dot to make it a function.
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        So we can choose to make our linear equation have an open dot. We write
        out its equation in our piecewise function, and put the restriction that
        this linear equation only exists if x < 2 (not equal as we decided it
        was an open dot)
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">

            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Perfect, now we have the first part of our equation. To move on, we have
        the second part of the piecewise function. We can see that it looks like
        a square root function (based on shape). We simply figure out the
        function’s equation based on its transformations and then go from there.
        So the function's parent is a square root function and it is simply
        moved 2 to the right. So the equation is as such based on
        transformations:
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img

            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        With this, we can put our newly discovered component to the piecewise
        function into the equation and look at its restriction. We see that the
        second component of the graph is restricted to only exist after x ≥ 2.
        We decided that this segment would have the closed dot, so we know that
        the restriction will be equal to 2. So once we add that restriction,
        it's complete!

        Now since our last example in this guide won’t include finding a
        piecewise function’s equation based on its graph, we will make this
        equation just a bit more complex by adding another function.

      <div class="inline">
        <p class="flexed-left">
          So here we have a cubic function that does not connect to the
          piecewise function, but we still follow the steps we were previously
          working with. Here we can see that its in the shape of a cubic
          function, and we can use our knowledge of transformations to create
          the equation. (Step 1) We know where the dipsy doodle is, and that
          gives us our shifts. (Step 2) Now we can just plug in a point to get
          our vertical dilation.

        Once we have the equation, we figure out where it is restricted. We see
        that the graph does not exist before x = 5 nor past x=15. The graph has
        a closed dot on both ends, so it in fact does reach those x values, just
        not any further. So we can add this final function into our slightly
        more complex completed piecewise function. And as you can see, the graph
        may seem strange, but just split it into parts like we have done so far
        and we will do great!

        Part 5: Determining a Piecewise Function's Continuity
      </h3>
      <p class="center-content hidden">
        Sometimes, piecewise functions are not continuous...
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        These are the cases where a piecewise function is discontinuous:
      </p>
      <ul class="list hidden">
        <li>
          The component is discontinuous in its own domain, like the reciprocal
          function
        </li>
        <li>
          Two components of the piecewise function don't meet up at the same y
          value
        </li>
        <li>
          The two components do meet up at the same y value but they both have
          an open dot where they meet up, meaning the value is unevaluable in
          the piecewise function
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        So to check for a piecewise function's continuity algebraically, you can
        check 3 things. You see whether or not each function is continuous in
        its own domain (part 0), whether or not the connection points or
        endpoints are existent in the piecewise function (part 2) and whether or
        not the piecewise function components meet up at the same x and y
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        On a graph, you can just see if the piecewise function is traceable
        without lifting a finger, but with equations, you will have to follow
        those 3 steps.
      </p>
      <p class="center-content hidden">
        So here is just a quick simple example of figuring out whether or not a
        piecewise function is continuous.
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">Here is an equation for a piecewise function:</p>
      <div class="inline">
        <div class="image-1 hidden">
          <a
            ><img
              src="public/Continuity.png"
              style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
              alt="piecewise function"
          /></a>
        </div>
        <p class="flexed-right hidden">
          We first check if the two individual components are continuous in
          their own domain. We see that the first is an exponential function and the
          second is linear. Both of these functions are continuous in their own domain, so step
          1 is complete.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="inline">
        <p class="flexed-left hidden">
          Second step is to evaluate whether or not the x at their connection
          point is evaluable. The connection point is shown in their
          restrictions, so use those x coordinates to check. Here we can plug x
          = 0 for the piecewise function as a whole and evaluate that it does
          exist.
        </p>
        <div class="image-1 hidden">
          <a
            ><img
              src="public/Cont2.png"
              style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
              alt="piecewise function"
          /></a>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        So now the final step is to check whether or not the piecewise functions
        actually meet up at the x coordinate in the same y coordinate. To do
        this, you just plug in the x endpoint value for both the first and
        second modular function within the piecewise. If both evaluate to the
        same y value, we know that the piecewise function components meetup and
        its continuous!
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/Continuous.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        If the piecewise function were discontinuous, we would have to state at
        which x value it was discontinuous based on our calculations.

      <h3 class="section-title hidden">Part 6: Overarching Example</h3>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Determine if this piecewise function is continuous, then graph it.
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/Final.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"

        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        So here we have our equation with 4 different components. It may seem
        daunting, but once again just work at it in parts, just like we did in
        part 1. So we are told to evaluate first whether or not this function is
        continuous. The first step is to check if each function is continuous in
        its own domain:
      </p>
      <ul class="list hidden">
        <li>Linear is continuous</li>
        <li>Linear is continuous</li>
        <li>Cubic is continuous</li>
        <li>Quadratic is continuous</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        So far this piecewise function's components are all continuous on their
        own. Now, we evaluate if all the connection points even exist in the
        piecewise function (checking for holes). To do this, we take the
        restrictive x values and plug them into the piecewise function.
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/Final2.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        But now we can see that g(8) is not even existent in the piecewise
        equation, because both sides of that x value are functions with open
        dots. So we can keep this in mind and write down that the piecewise
        function is discontinuous @ x = 8.
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Now that we have figured out if all the endpoints exist in the piecewise
        function, we can figure out if the components of the function meet up
        together or not. So we evaluate the first 2 components:
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/Final3.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Their meet up x value is @ x = 2, so we plug in 2 for both the
        functions. We can see that they evaluate to the same y value, and thus
        they meet up and are continuous!
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Now we do that for the second and third component:
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Their meet up x value is @ x = 4, so we plug those values into the two
        components:
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/Final4.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Now we see that the two values do not evaluate to each
        other. This means that the function is discontinuous @ x = 4. And we
        don’t need to evaluate the last connection point as we already know the
        two functions aren’t continuous @ x = 8 from the first step.
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Once we have figured out the continuity, we can write our therefore
        statement and start graphing:
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/Final5.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        So now to start graphing, we can divide our cartesian plane based on the
        restrictions that we know (just like from part 1):
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/Cartesian.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="center-content hidden">
        We can graph the first linear equation using our knowledge of
        transformations:
      </p>
      <div class="image-1 hidden ">
        <a
          ><img
            src="public/Final6.png"
            style="width: 25rem; margin-right: 5rem; border-radius: 3rem;"
            alt="piecewise function"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Once we have drawn the equation, we can use our segments that we have
        already divided up to know when to stop our function.
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        We do this exact same process for the next 3 functions as seen:
      </p>
        <div class="image-1 hidden">

      <p class="left-content hidden">
        The explanations for transformations are not encompassed in this lesson.
      </p>
      <p class="left-content hidden">
        Now we have our graph and we can put the name onto it and double check
        our work. We can see that the graph is not continuous at x = 4 and x = 8
        but it is continuous at x = -1, just like our algebra showed.
